# Facebook Login for Web with RapidAPI


#### Steps for Using Facebook Login With the JavaScript SDK

There are a few steps that you will need to follow to integrate Facebook Login into your web application, most of which are included in the quickstart example at the top of this page. 

###### At a high level those are:
Checking the login status to see if someone's already logged into your app. During this step, you also should check to see if someone has previously logged into your app, but is not currently logged in.
If they are not logged in, invoke the login dialog and ask for a set of data permissions.

* Verify their identity.
* Store the resulting access token.
* Make API calls.
* Log out.

This is the full Facebook SDK documentation for the javascript SDK.
